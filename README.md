## TWG Operating Model Recommendation from Segment 3

We recommend that the technical working group members of subsequent segments learn from and adopt our team working model.  The TWG should also endeavor to improve the model and document the changes in the group wiki on Github.

-  Break down deliverables for the segment, and establish milestones for each to ensure steady progress toward the segment goals.
- Hold, at a minimum, a weekly standup call to report progress, identify problems, and assign work.
- Use Slack to communicate with the team and make announcements.
- Assign a leader for each deliverable who can engage others on the team for input, but is responsible for ensuring the milestone is met.
- Open issues to establish topics and engage in discussion of the topic within the issue.
- Once research is complete, and a deliverable has been fleshed out in the issue discussions, create a wiki page for the deliverable with the summary findings and recommendations.
- At the end of the segment, port the wiki content to a single recommendation document to be distributed to stakeholders.
